                CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

            <p id="bdrclp1">Margin collapse occurs when vertically adjacent margins of block-level elements collide to share a general margin space. The size of this shared space is dictated by the larger number margin.You can visualize this as an arm wrestling match, where the larger margin will take over and win.
            </p>
            <p id="bdrclp2">It is important to clarify what it means to be the larger number.If a margin of 70px collides with a margin of 90px, the 90px margin will win. If a margin of -70px collides with a margin of -90px, -90px will win.</p>
